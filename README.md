Orso is not intended to compete with [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/) or [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (or your favorite Dataframe technology), instead it is developed as a common layer for HadroDB and Opteryx.

If you aren't using HadroDB or Opteryx, we recommend Polars.

## Status

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-alpha-orange)](https://github.com/mabel-dev/orso)

Orso is in alpha. Alpha means different things to different people, to us, being alpha means:

- Interfaces may be significantly changed
- Expected functionality is missing
- Things that worked yesterday, don't work today
- The results of the system may be unreliable

As such, we really don't recommend using Orso anywhere where your data matters.
